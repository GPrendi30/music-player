*Note:  We as a group, came together(while respecting the social distancing and other rules) and went into detail about the implementation.
 If anything that is listed in the previous parts of the document is not allowed or against the rules, please inform us. 

Question: Above the others, can we use racket/gui? it would simplify the process of designing.
