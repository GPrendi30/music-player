\section*{Abstract}

  The program is a music playback program written in Advanced Student Language.
  It can play \textit{most audio files}. Allows you to import audio files and make playlists containing them. \\
  It displays information regarding the song that is being played, like: 
  \begin{itemize}
   \item singer
   \item author
   \item duration
   \item album name
   \item album cover etc..
  \end{itemize}
Possible to search not only songs, but also for playlists, artists or albums using the search bar.Sorting is another option, where you can choose from A to Z or reverse.\\
You can add a song to "Favorites". Seek playback by clicking on the progress bar.
  \subsection*{Functionality}
  \begin{itemize}
   \item import audio files into the program
   \item playback the audio files
   \item playback seek by clicking the progress bar
   \item create and edit playlists
   \item add songs to "favorites"
   \item change the theme of the program
   \item shuffle the songs in the current playlist
   \item loop through the playlist, or a single song
   \item search for songs, artists, albums or playlis
   \item skip the current song or go back to the previous song in the playlist
   \item sort the songs and/or playlists
  \end{itemize}


\section*{Infrastructure}
 \paragraph{}
 The work will be adjusted between:\\
    -  Microsoft Teams,\\
    -  Whatsapp,\\
    -  Notion(for note-taking),\\
    -  Versioning System: SubVersioN(svn)\\
      
               
\subsection*{Repository}
  \begin{figure}[h]
   \includegraphics[width=500px,height=300px]{repository.png}
  \end{figure}
  We thought it was better, that the work Repository to be a multi file/folder project, in order for everybody to work in parallel.
  \paragraph{Explanation:}
   \textbf{`main.rkt'} is the main executable file, everything will come down to main(It will one have the implementation of big-bang)\\
   \textbf{'lib'} folder is the folder where libraries will be installed, we intend to download and put libraries we usually require or install using 'raco' in there.\\
   \textbf{'modules'} folder will have files: 'modules' we created ourselves and will link them to main\\
   \textbf{'docs'} will have the documentation\\
   \textbf{'db'} will host the info files, in form of database(we will not implement a database, just plain text files)\\
   \textbf{'icons'} is a folder for icons needed\\
   \textbf{'logs'} will have error messages or known bugs, that will be fixed\\
   \textbf{'test'} folder will have test files, for each main modules\\

\subsection*{Delivery:}
  The project will be delivered in two ways:\\
  - an executable file\\
  - source code \\
  
\section*{Plan of Work}
\subsection*{Steps:}
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item First we concept and create a basic idea, with functionalities
  \item Structure ideas and start visualising the program and work flow
  \item Think of Data Structures, that will be used
  \item Work on the backend and think of ideas to handle under the hood work, meanwhile two Members work on design
  \item The design will be ready, and the backend will be ready too
  \item Group gathers and start building the GUI(part by part as LEGO bricks)
  \item Connect GUI with backend
  \item Test and Debug
  \item Deliver the project, continue maintaining
 \end{enumerate}
\newpage
 \subsection*{Implementation:}
 \subsubsection*{Requirements :}
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Modules:
  \subitem racket/system
  \subitem htdp/batch-io
  \subitem 2htdp/image
  \subitem 2htpd/universe
  \item Language: 
  \subitem    Advanced Student Language (ASL)
  \item We will use a command line program (which we will control from our racket program) that will play the media files, will be on our lib folder. Program name = mpv
  \item *Note during the work, we might come up different modules, will consult TA's if we can use them or not
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Data Structures:}
\begin{itemize}
 \item List 
 \item Struct
 \item Atomic Data Structures
 \item hashes : mostly on the `Database` 
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Features:}
 \begin{itemize}
  \item String Comparison(and Sort)
  \item Implementation of Quick Sort
  \item Input/Output in/from files
  \item Modules(created and called by us)
  \item Printing Contents of a directory
  \item Creating registries with hashes(playlists and songs)
 \end{itemize}


\section*{**Note :}
 The whole group helped in the making of this document: \\
 - the design was done by Paola and Lidia as well as spell check and correction. \\
 - abstract and featuring was done by Ramazan.\\
 We as a group, came together(while respecting the social distancing and other rules) and went into detail about the implementation.\\
 If anything that is listed in the previous parts of the document is not allowed or against the rules, please inform us.\\

 
\textbf{Is it possible to use racket/gui , it would help us speed up the process of designing the GUI of the program?\\}

\textbf{If you have any questions, feel free to contact us.\newline}
